# Randomizer Design Specs

## Goal
A browser page with a button that, on being clicked, will print to the screen a random line from a text file. The file can be chosen from a dropdown menu. There will also be an option to choose from an on-screen list, to save the list as a new text file, or to edit one of the existing text files in the browser window. 

## Milestones
1. A button that, on being clicked, will print to the screen a random element from a (hard-coded) list of strings.
2. Populate the list from a text file.
3. Implement a dropdown menu to choose the file.
4. Show the list in the browser window (perhaps create a box that expands when clicked, so the screen is not cluttered by default).
5. Allow the user to edit the list in the browser window.
6. Allow the user to save those changes to the file.
7. Allow the user to save the list as a new file.
8. Implement file management in the browser window (ie delete or rename files).

## Stretch goal
Nested lists, so I can choose between categories of tasks, and then choose a task within that category.


## Milestone subtasks
